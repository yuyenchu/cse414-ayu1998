This is my first time using such kind of service, 
there are so many functions in Azure that I haven't explored yet. 
It's really more convinent to have those GUI on the website and VScode rather than typing in the terminal,
but I actually didn't use much of the functions in this assignment.
I think it's not a bad idea to use DBMS cloud service, 
but if the data goes even bigger,
we might need our own server due to the speed of transmitting data.
Also, since this is just an class assignment, 
we don't have to worry a lot,
but if it's a company project,
there would be more things to be worried about.
For example, security could be a problem.
First, the cloud service is run by microsoft, 
so there would be risks of data leak from them, 
such as backdoors created by the developer.
Second, if someone hack into the server,
we cannot directly control the server since it's run by others.
Third, if the DBMS goes pulic, 
we might need another way to regulate and record people accessing it.
Also, when microsoft or others whose using their service get attacked,
the data we stored on the cloud may also got affected,
so how to sotre backups could be a issue to discuss.
We usually think these kind of prolem might not be a big deal 
because our work isn't "that" important and the "faith" we put in microsoft,
but as the importance and resource put in the project grows, 
there would be more things to consider.
So personally saying,
if I got the time and resource,
I might prefer setting up my own server becuase I don't want to leave the control to others.
But this service is a really good idea for smaller projects, new developers, or companies which lack of resource,
it gives them what they need to complete their projects,
which would eventually help them more likely to achieve their goals.
